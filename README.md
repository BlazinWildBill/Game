Game

In our game, you can choose a class, level up, cast spells, and attack mobs until you die.

# Day 1 of game

I want to be able to level up a character, and increase its stats.

The stats of each character:
Level
Attack
Magic
Defense
Speed
Health 
Mana

In our game, 10 is a very strong stat, the max to start with. 1 is the lowest.
These are the boundaries we are going to define.

Health and Mana are different; they have no bounds

Mage is a high mana, high magic, but low HP/attack character with average quickness. Starts with Fireball spell

Paladin is a High HP/defense, low attack, low magic/mana slow character. Tanky, but can use summons to deal damage. Starts with a Wolf.

Warrior is a High attack, moderate HP/Defense, low magic/mana, moderately quick character who wields the weapon Mjolnir, a throwable hammer. Starts with a Phoenix pet.
